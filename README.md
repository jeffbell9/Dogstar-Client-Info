####This was my first project. I wanted to come up with something useful for my girlfriend
####who owns and operates her own dog walking business. We decided that having a way to store
####and retrieve client information on her computer instead of having to fish out the paper
####form would be useful. I wanted to store the data in the browser, so I found out about
#### local storage and how to use it.
